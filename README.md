# SkyInvaders

Hey! 

This is my first project as a IronHack student, to be submitted on December 18th, 2021.
It's called SkyInvader, because it's inspirated from Space Invader of course. It's written in Javascript, CSS and HTML. I learned how to do cool sprite animation while doing this project, and I really want to add some new features, even if i'ts already submitted. I'll add bullets for the enemies, and surely make it harder!

Here is a preview of how it looks :
